==================================================

[00:00] I've always been jealous of Winston Churchill.
[00:02] There's a quote, by the way.
[00:04] The history of innovation
is the bed, the bus and the bathtub.
[00:08] It's always these moments
when we're not really thinking about work
[00:11] or we're kind of doing something else
that good ideas come to us.
[00:15] Winston Churchill,
[00:16] He's sitting in the bathtub,
and he's dictating a national address
[00:20] to his assistant who's in the other room.
[00:22] She's saying, "distinguished ladies and gentlemen"
[00:25] "Don't call them distinguished"
[00:27] "They're not"
[00:28] This is the Gary Oldman version.
"They're not distinguished."
[00:31] You know, "Dear ladies and gentlemen, we have gathered together."
[00:35] "Get to the point!"
[00:37] and I'm watching this going
[00:39] I would give anything to have an assistant
who understood my context and my voice and
[00:45] my intent well enough that I could sit in
the bath and they could write my speech.
[00:50] Now, the poorest villager in Palo Alto
[00:54] can have what only Winston Churchill
[00:57] used to have,
[00:58] which is an assistant that has my context
and my voice and my intent available to me
[01:04] so that when I'm in the bathtub,
I can be dictating my address.
[01:08] That is absolutely
technically possible today.
[01:12] Exploring Human Agency in the age of AI
[01:15] Exploring Human Agency in the age of AI : Uncoded
[01:18] Ep.1 How to Become a Better Collaborator with AI
[01:20] I'm Jeremy Utley,
I'm an adjunct professor of creativity
[01:24] and AI at Stanford University.
[01:26] I've been teaching at Stanford
for the last 15 years
[01:29] at the intersection of creativity,
innovation, entrepreneurship, and now
[01:33] increasingly, artificial intelligence.
[01:35] The topic that I'm most focused on right
now is helping non-technical professionals
[01:41] learn to be good collaborators to or with generative AI. 
[01:46] And then two years ago,
[01:47] myself and my partner at the time,
Perry Klebahn, wrote a book called
[01:51] Idea Flow, which was the canonical book
on idea generation and prototyping.
[01:56] So super proud of that.
[01:58] It was the culmination of a dozen years
of leading executive programs
[02:02] and the leadership program and the
entrepreneurship program at Stanford.
[02:06] And one month after our book came out,
ChatGPT came out.
[02:11] To me, the fact that I wrote the canonical book
on Idea generation just prior to AI
[02:18] is like writing the best book on retail
just before the internet.
[02:23] AI is a tool to dramatically augment
and amplify our creativity.
[02:28] And the truth is, I didn't know
a lot about it when the book came out.
[02:31] So one month after my book came out,
instead of going on a world book tour,
[02:36] I strapped myself back into the front row
as a student and said,
[02:41] I need to be learning about
this transformative new technology.
[02:44] So I started taking classes.
I started conducting research.
[02:47] I started working with and studying teams
inside of organizations, using the tool
[02:52] to understand the simple question,
[02:55] how does generative AI impact
the individual and the team and the
[03:00] organization's ability to solve problems?
[03:04] Chapter1. Don't Ask AI, Let It Ask You
[03:06] You can give an AI a prompt, for example.
[03:09] How should I answer this question?
[03:12] Or you could give an AI
the question
[03:15] I want to ask how I should answer this question.
[03:18] What's the best way of framing
that question to an AI?
[03:22] So you see what I did there?
[03:24] I asked AI for how to ask I my question,
[03:28] but you can use AI to use AI, which is
you couldn't use Excel to use Excel.
[03:33] PowerPoint can't teach you how to use PowerPoint.
[03:35] Email can't teach you how to use email.
[03:37] AI strangely can teach you
how to use itself if you think to ask.
[03:41] Go to your language model of choice
and just say the following.
[03:45] Hey, you're an AI expert.
[03:48] I would love your help and a consultation
with you to help me figure out
[03:53] where I can best leverage AI in my life.
[03:56] As an AI expert, would you please ask
me questions one question at a time,
[04:01] until you have enough context about my
workflows and responsibilities and KPIs
[04:05] and and objectives that you could
[04:07] make two obvious recommendations
and two non-obvious recommendations
[04:12] for how AI could leverage AI in my work.
[04:15] you will have one of the most enlightening
and illuminating conversations you've ever had,
[04:20] and it's all because of AI's ability to evaluate its own work. 
[04:24] What I've seen is non-technical employees
are able to do incredible things.
[04:28] Here's one example.
[04:29] The National Park Service called me
and asked me if I would
[04:33] conduct a training program
for a bunch of backcountry rangers,
[04:37] so they gathered a group of about 60
backcountry rangers and facilities managers
[04:42] into a training session,
[04:43] and I spent a couple of hours over zoom
teaching folks the basics of collaborating with AI.
[04:49] One of the people in that
session was a gentleman named Adam Rymer,
[04:53] who works at Glen Canyon National Park.
[04:55] And one of the things I say is you
should focus on parts of your work that you dread.
[05:00] Parts of your work that you don't enjoy.
[05:03] "Ah, I have to do this again."
[05:05] And Adam said, if I have to replace
the carpet tiles in the lodge.
[05:09] I have to fill out all this paperwork.
[05:10] And so to replace a carpet tile will
sometimes take 2 or 3 days of paperwork.
[05:15] Then he thought,
could AI help me write that paperwork?
[05:18] And in 45 minutes,
he built a tool with natural language
[05:23] that saves him two days of work.
[05:26] Every day he makes a statement of work
and then listen to this.
[05:30] Someone got access to that tool
and shared it across the other parks.
[05:35] There's about 430 parks in the service.
[05:38] The National Park Service is estimating
that the tool that Adam built in 45 minutes
[05:42] is going to save the service 7000 days of human labor this year.
[05:48] That's the kind of impact that normal
professionals can have, even without
[05:55] any technical ability, if only they're given
very basic foundational training.
[06:02] Chapter2. Do not Use AI, Treat It as a Teammate
[06:04] People are wanting to learn AI and how it
can be transformative for their business,
[06:08] but they don't have the basic language.
[06:11] And so while lots of organizations
are asking me how can we work with AI
[06:15] to transform our business?
[06:16] Where I have to start with them is
how do you work with AI?
[06:20] The research I'm familiar with suggests
that while on the one hand,
[06:23] AI makes people 25% faster
and 12% more work and 40% better quality,
[06:29] it's also true that less than 10%
of working professionals
[06:33] are deriving meaningful productivity gains
from collaboration with AI.
[06:37] To me, there's this enormous gap.
I call it the realization gap.
[06:42] We conducted studies both
in Europe and in the United States.
[06:45] And what we found is, surprisingly, AI
didn't help most people be more creative.
[06:51] In fact, in many cases, the people that we
studied, AI made them less creative.
[06:56] And as we started digging
into the research,
[06:58] we were surprised and looked at the data.
[07:00] We were confused because you
think AI should make people
[07:04] more creative, not less.
[07:05] And we studied the underperformers
and then we studied the Outperformers.
[07:10] And what we found is the Outperformers
had a fundamentally different orientation
[07:15] towards AI than the underperformers did,
whereas the underperformers
[07:21] treated AI like a tool.
[07:23] The outperformers
treated AI like a teammate,
[07:28] and shifting your orientation
from tool to teammate changes everything
[07:33] about the kinds of outcomes that you can achieve
[07:36] working with generative AI.
A simple example is what do you do
[07:40] when it gives you mediocre results?
[07:43] If it's a tool, you get a mediocre result
and then maybe you improve it.
[07:48] Or maybe you say,
it's no good at doing that.
[07:51] If it's a teammate
who's giving you a mediocre result,
[07:54] think about the last teammate who gave you
work product that wasn't sufficient.
[07:58] You gave them feedback.
[07:59] You gave them coaching, you gave them
mentorship, you helped them improve it.
[08:04] And so what we found is that people
who treat AI like a teammate, coach it
[08:08] and give it feedback and importantly,
get it to ask them questions.
[08:13] The fundamental orientation
a lot of people take towards AI
[08:16] is I'm the question asker.
[08:18] AI is the answer giver.
[08:20] But if you think about AI like a teammate,
you say, hey, what are ten questions
[08:25] I should ask about this?
[08:26] Or what do you need to know from me
in order to get the best response?
[08:31] So things, for example,
like you have a difficult conversation
[08:34] coming up with a coworker.
[08:36] Did you know you could leverage
a large language model
[08:38] to roleplay that conversation?
[08:41] You can get an AI to interview you
about your conversation partner,
[08:45] and then construct a psychological profile
of your conversation partner,
[08:49] and then play the role of your
conversation partner in a roleplay,
[08:53] and then give you feedback from the
perspective of your conversation partner
[08:57] on how you approach the conversation.
[08:59] That's something you can do today,
and there are many things like that.
[09:03] I call them drills,
[09:04] but there are many things like that
where if someone will just shift
[09:08] their consideration set of what
[09:11] are the things I can do with AI.
They end up discovering applications
[09:16] that I've never even dreamed of.
[09:17] I've been doing this stuff for two years,
and my students are regularly
[09:21] coming to me with use cases I've never
imagined that landed them in a destination
[09:26] I could have never predicted,
[09:27] and they could never have predicted.
[09:30] For me, I never thought about myself
as a creative individual.
[09:33] Now, I fully and fundamentally believe
every single human being
[09:38] has innate creative capacity.
[09:40] Every single one of us.
[09:41] What the D.school has helped me do
is unlock others.
[09:45] Everyone has
this latent creative capacity.
[09:48] Once I was teaching a class
with a hip hop artist named Lecrae.
[09:52] He's a multi-time Grammy Award winning
artist, and he and I are teaching a class
[09:56] to graduate students at Stanford,
and we're giving them the assignment.
[09:59] You've got to go get
inspiration in the world.
[10:01] And what I can see is it's like looking
at myself in the mirror ten years ago,
[10:05] because all
of the business school students
[10:06] in the class are going, "inspiration?"
[10:10] And I just felt Lecrae is clearly
the The creative legend in the room.
[10:15] I said, Lecrae,
what do you think about inspiration?
[10:18] And of course, as only a hip hop
artist could do, he dropped a bar.
[10:21] He said, inspiration is a discipline.
[10:24] And I realized in that moment,
for these students,
[10:27] it's not even on their radar as a tool,
let alone a routine part of their life.
[10:33] But the most wildly creative individuals
I know are disciplined about cultivating
[10:39] the inputs to their thinking,
because they know it affects
[10:41] the outputs of their thinking.
[10:43] And so, even in regards to AI,
I push people.
[10:47] What is the inspiration
you're bringing to the model?
[10:49] Everybody has the same access
to the same ChatGPT.
[10:53] How do I get a different output
than you do?
[10:55] It's because of what I bring to the model.
And what do I bring to the model?
[10:59] Certainly I bring technique,
but I also bring my experience.
[11:03] I bring my perspective.
[11:04] I bring all the inspiration
I've gleaned from the world.
[11:07] That's what gets a user
a differential output from a model.
[11:11] Chapter3. How to Go Beyond â€˜Good Enoughâ€™ Ideas
[11:14] A seventh grader in Ohio
who I don't even know what her name is,
[11:18] but her teacher asked, what is creativity?
[11:20] And she put a post-it note up on the board that says,
[11:22] Creativity is doing more
[11:24] than the first thing you think of.
[11:27] And that's my favorite definition,
because it speaks to a profound
[11:31] cognitive bias that we hold.
[11:33] It's been called functional fixedness.
It's been called the Einstellung effect.
[11:37] But the basic premise is humans tend
to fixate on an early solution
[11:44] and be satisfied.
[11:45] Herbert Simon called it satisficing,
but it's the idea that if we get
[11:49] to good enough, it's enough.
[11:51] And that's why I love
that seventh graders definition.
[11:53] Creativity is doing more
than the first thing you think of.
[11:56] It's pushing past. Good enough.
[11:59] Is the definition of creativity
changing in the age of AI?
[12:03] I don't think so.
[12:04] The reality is, with AI, it's now easier
than ever to get good enough.
[12:10] If your goal is world class,
if your goal is exceptional, then what you
[12:14] want to be prompting for is actually
volume and variation, and that takes time.
[12:20] It takes time to not only read through it,
but to sort it and to process it.
[12:25] But fundamentally, the definition
of creativity doesn't change in the age of AI.
[12:30] It's just that the human's ability
or inability to arrive at a creative state
[12:35] is affected not only by the technology,
[12:38] but also by their stated or unstated
objectives in collaborating with it.
[12:45] Creators don't need to be afraid of AI.
Creators need to dive in.
[12:49] They need to lean in.
[12:50] Creators are about to be unleashed in
a way they've never been unleashed before.
[12:55] The only correct answer
to the question how do you use AI?
[12:59] Is I don't.
I don't use AI. I work with it.
[13:04] When you start working with AI,
it will change everything.
