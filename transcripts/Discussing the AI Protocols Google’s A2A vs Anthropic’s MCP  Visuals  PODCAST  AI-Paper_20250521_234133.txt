==================================================

[00:00] Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're uh
[00:02] tackling something pretty central to
[00:04] where AI is heading. Right. It's all
[00:06] about getting these AI agents which are
[00:08] getting smarter all the time to actually
[00:10] work together and you know work with all
[00:12] the tools and data they need. Exactly.
[00:15] Because for ages linking different AI
[00:17] systems or connecting an AI to a
[00:19] specific tool has meant writing tons of
[00:22] custom code. Real complex stuff. Yeah.
[00:25] Like messy glue code. Just trying to
[00:27] patch things together. It's not
[00:29] scalable. Not really. And as these
[00:31] systems get more complex, that old way
[00:33] just won't cut it. We need something
[00:35] more standardized. Which brings us
[00:36] nicely to today's topic. We're looking
[00:38] at two potential open standards aiming
[00:40] to solve this. Google's agentto agent
[00:43] protocol, A2A and Anthropic's model
[00:46] context protocol or MCP. Right. And
[00:48] they're both about integration, but they
[00:50] come at it from well different angles.
[00:52] Yeah. A2A seems more focused on like how
[00:54] agents talk to each other, collaboration
[00:57] between them. Precisely. It's the
[00:58] horizontal communication piece. Whereas
[01:00] MCP, you could say, is more focused
[01:02] vertically. Vertically meaning meaning
[01:05] how a single agent connects down to its
[01:07] environment, the tools it needs, the
[01:09] data it have to access, standardizing
[01:11] that connection. Okay, got it.
[01:13] Horizontal for agent to agent, vertical
[01:15] for agent to environment. You've got it.
[01:17] And to really get a handle on this,
[01:18] we're going to be uh digging into a
[01:20] table that compares them side by side,
[01:23] feature by feature. Sounds like a plan.
[01:25] It lays out the terms, the features, the
[01:26] roles. Our mission today is basically to
[01:29] unpack that table for you, make sense of
[01:31] the jargon, and really clarify what A2A
[01:34] and MCP are each trying to do. Ready to
[01:36] jump in? Let's do it. So, first up on
[01:38] the table, primary focus. Okay. For A2A,
[01:41] it says agentto agent communication and
[01:44] collaboration. Pretty straightforward
[01:46] given the name. Yeah, it's right there.
[01:48] It's about enabling these potentially
[01:50] independent AI agents to, you know,
[01:52] coordinate, share work, act like a team.
[01:54] And the design really reflects that,
[01:56] focusing on secure chat, task
[01:58] management, things that mimic well, real
[02:00] collaboration. Makes sense. Now, for
[02:02] MCP, the focus is listed as agentto
[02:05] tool, data source connection, and
[02:06] context management. So, a clear
[02:09] difference right off the bat, not agent
[02:11] to agent, but agent to things, right?
[02:13] It's about how one agent gets the
[02:17] information or triggers the action it
[02:18] needs from the outside world. Basically
[02:21] standardizing that interaction like
[02:22] defining the rules for how an AI uses
[02:25] say a specific API or database. Okay.
[02:28] This difference in focus naturally leads
[02:30] to the next point integration type.
[02:32] Yeah. A2A is horizontal inter agent.
[02:35] Horizontal meaning across between peers
[02:38] like agents talking directly to each
[02:40] other on the same level. Exactly.
[02:41] Peer-to-peer communication. And MCP MCP
[02:44] is vertical inter aent to environment.
[02:48] So connecting one agent down to the
[02:49] resources it needs extending its own
[02:51] capabilities downward so to speak
[02:53] precisely one's about the network
[02:55] conversation the other's about an
[02:56] individual's reach. Okay let's look at
[02:58] the core architecture A2A uses a client
[03:00] agent remote agent model. What's that
[03:03] dynamic like? It's basically a
[03:04] requesttoresponder model. One agent the
[03:06] client asks for something initiates a
[03:08] task. The other agent the remote does
[03:11] the work. But it's not fixed, right? No.
[03:13] Exactly. An agent could be a client in
[03:15] one interaction and a remote in the
[03:17] next. Wow, very flexible. Allows for
[03:19] that peer-to-peer feel we mentioned.
[03:21] Makes sense for collaboration. You might
[03:23] need to ask for help, then offer your
[03:24] own skills later. What about MCP's
[03:27] architecture? It's host client server.
[03:29] Sounds a bit more layered. It is. The
[03:31] host is usually the main AI application
[03:34] the user sees. Inside that, there's a
[03:36] client component like a specific
[03:38] connector or manager. Okay. And that
[03:40] client talks to a server which is the
[03:42] thing actually providing the tool or the
[03:45] data. So AI connector service provider
[03:48] three distinct parts right. It offers a
[03:50] more controlled structured way to access
[03:52] those external functions. The client
[03:54] acts as a kind of gatekeeper or
[03:55] intermediary. I can see how that helps
[03:57] manage things maybe security too.
[03:59] Definitely. It handles formatting maybe
[04:01] some initial checks. We'll probably
[04:03] touch on security later. Okay, let's
[04:04] move to key components. This is where we
[04:06] get into the nitty-gritty building
[04:08] blocks. A2A lists. Agent card, task,
[04:12] message, part, artifact. Let's start
[04:14] with agent card. Think of the agent card
[04:16] as uh like an agent's business card or
[04:19] online profile. It's how it advertises
[04:22] itself. So what it can do, how to talk
[04:25] to it exactly its name, skills, the
[04:28] endpoint for communication, usually
[04:30] found at a standard web location like
[04:32] well-known agent.json. It's key for
[04:35] discovery, finding other agents to work
[04:37] with. The foundation for that horizontal
[04:39] chat. Okay. Next is task. The task is
[04:42] the core unit of work. It's the actual
[04:44] request sent from a client agent to a
[04:46] remote agent. And importantly, it has a
[04:48] life cycle. Life cycle like tracking its
[04:51] progress. Yeah. States like submitted,
[04:53] working, completed, failed. So both
[04:55] agents know what's happening with the
[04:56] request. It's not just fire and forget.
[04:58] Right. Essential for managing
[04:59] collaboration. Then we have message and
[05:01] part. So within a task, the agents
[05:03] exchange messages. Each message has a
[05:05] role like user or agent and contains one
[05:08] or more parts. And the part is the
[05:10] actual content. Yes, that's the payload.
[05:14] It could be text, structured data like
[05:16] JSON, files, even audio or video. Each
[05:19] part has a type like a my E type. So the
[05:22] receiving agent knows what it is and how
[05:24] to handle it. Allows for really rich
[05:26] communication. Messages carry the
[05:28] conversation parts are the different
[05:29] kinds of stuff being said. Makes sense.
[05:31] Last one for A2A is artifact. Artifacts
[05:35] are the outputs, the results generated
[05:37] by the remote agent while working on a
[05:39] task. Think uh a generated report,
[05:42] analyzed data, a translated document,
[05:44] and they're immutable, right? Meaning
[05:46] they don't change once created. A task
[05:48] can produce multiple artifacts, and they
[05:50] can even be streamed back as they're
[05:51] produced. Okay, so A2A's components
[05:53] really describe a system for agents
[05:55] finding each other, exchanging detailed
[05:56] requests with rich content, tracking
[05:59] progress, and getting verifiable
[06:00] results. Let's switch to MCP's
[06:02] components. host, client, server. We've
[06:04] covered those. Then tool, resource,
[06:06] prompt, and also group sampling. What's
[06:09] a tool in MCP? A tool is basically an
[06:12] action or function the server offers.
[06:13] Sending an email, looking up a stock
[06:15] price, summarizing text. Those are
[06:16] tools. So, the verbs of the MCP world.
[06:18] Good way to put it. Yeah. Each tool has
[06:20] a name, description, and crucially, an
[06:23] input schema. So, the AI host knows how
[06:25] to call it correctly, usually via a
[06:28] method like tool skull. Okay. If tools
[06:31] are verbs, what are resources? Resources
[06:34] are the nouns, the data or content the
[06:36] server provides access to. Could be a
[06:38] documents, text, calendar entries,
[06:40] database records, stuff the AI needs to
[06:42] read or know about. Exactly. Identified
[06:44] by URI, usually accessed via method like
[06:47] resources read. So tools for doing,
[06:50] resources for knowing, clear
[06:52] distinction. Then there's prompt.
[06:54] Prompts in MCP are predefined templates
[06:56] or scripts the server can provide. It
[06:58] might guide the AI's text generation or
[07:00] structure a complex request like
[07:02] reusable recipes the AI can use sort of.
[07:04] Yeah. Retrieve them with something like
[07:06] prompts get maybe fill in blanks using
[07:09] data from resources or tool results.
[07:11] Interesting. And the ones in parenthesis
[07:12] root sampling. Uh root is more about
[07:14] client side file access permissions in
[07:16] some cases. Sampling is quite advanced.
[07:18] It's where the server can actually ask
[07:20] the host AI to generate text based on a
[07:22] prompt. Whoa. Okay. So the server can
[07:24] prompt the main AI. That's different. It
[07:26] allows for some interesting
[07:27] collaborative generation possibilities.
[07:30] Yeah. So, MCP's components are really
[07:32] focused on giving that host AI
[07:34] standardized ways to use external
[07:35] functions and access specific data.
[07:37] Let's talk communication protocol. A2A
[07:40] uses JSON RPC 2.0 over HTTPS, SSE, push
[07:44] notifications. Seems like standard web
[07:46] tech. It is. JSON RPC is a lightweight
[07:49] way to make requests. Running it over
[07:51] HTTP or HTTPS makes it web friendly. SSC
[07:54] server sent events. That's for real-time
[07:56] updates from the server, which is good
[07:58] for those longunning tasks we mentioned.
[08:00] Exactly. And push notifications mean an
[08:02] agent can get alerted even if it's not
[08:04] actively connected via SSE at that
[08:06] moment. Ensures updates aren't missed.
[08:08] Robust stuff for async work. Now, MCP
[08:10] uses JSON RPC 2.0 over steadyio HTTPS
[08:15] plus SSE. It adds steady. What's that?
[08:18] Stdio is standard input output. It means
[08:21] MCP can also work locally between
[08:23] processes on the same machine just using
[08:25] the basic OS pipes for communication. Ah
[08:27] so it works for connecting to local
[08:28] tools as well as remote web services.
[08:30] Precisely adds flexibility depending on
[08:33] where the server component lives. Local
[08:35] utility remote API MCP can handle both.
[08:38] Makes sense for that agent to
[08:39] environment focus. Okay. Scope A2AS is
[08:42] interaction and coordination between
[08:44] multiple agents. Reinforces that core
[08:46] idea. Yep. It's built for the multi-
[08:48] aent world for systems where different
[08:50] AIs need to collaborate and MCP scope
[08:52] individual agents access to external
[08:54] info and capabilities again emphasizes
[08:57] the single agent extending its reach.
[09:00] That's the core difference really. A2A
[09:02] the network MCP the nodes connections.
[09:04] This flows right into intended use
[09:06] cases. A2A is for multi-agent workflows,
[09:09] task delegation, cross-system
[09:11] collaboration like that hiring example,
[09:13] different agents handling screening,
[09:15] interviewing, etc. Yeah. complex
[09:17] processes broken down and shared and for
[09:19] MCP data retrieval tool in recation and
[09:21] context enrichment for agents the
[09:23] example was an AI writing assistant
[09:25] needing calendar access to draft an
[09:27] email perfect MCP scenario fetching data
[09:30] using a tool all to help that one agent
[09:32] do its job better so A2A builds the
[09:34] collaborative team MCP equips the
[09:37] individual players let's talk security
[09:39] focus A2A emphasizes secure agent
[09:42] identity authentication authorization
[09:44] encryption seems vital If agents are
[09:47] trusting each other, absolutely
[09:48] critical. You need to know who you're
[09:49] talking to, what they're allowed to ask
[09:51] for or do, and ensure the conversation
[09:53] is private, especially with sensitive
[09:55] tasks or data. And MCP's focus, user
[09:58] consent, sandboxing, controlled tool
[10:00] resource access. More about protecting
[10:03] the user and the system from the
[10:04] external connection. Exactly. Since MCP
[10:06] often involves an AI acting on a user's
[10:08] behalf to access external things, user
[10:11] control is key. Sandboxing helps prevent
[10:13] the external tool from doing unexpected
[10:14] things and access control limits what
[10:17] the AI can actually ask for or do via
[10:19] MCP. Two different security perspectives
[10:22] matching their different roles. How
[10:23] about modality support? What kinds of
[10:25] data can they handle? A2A lists, text,
[10:28] files, structured data, JSON forms,
[10:31] audio, video. Wow, pretty broad. Yeah,
[10:34] A2A aims to be quite comprehensive,
[10:36] reflecting the varieties of information
[10:37] agents might need to share in complex
[10:39] collaborations.
[10:40] NMCP primarily text files binary via
[10:44] blob structured data a bit more focused
[10:47] it seems so initially at least covering
[10:49] the common basis for tool and data
[10:51] interaction the blob binary large object
[10:54] does allow for sending any kind of file
[10:56] though okay so still flexible but maybe
[10:59] less explicitly focused on multimedia
[11:01] upfront compared to A2A how about
[11:03] handling delays asynchronicity A2A has
[11:06] native support for longunning tasks SSE
[11:09] push Push. We talked about SSE. How do
[11:12] push notifications fit in? Push lets a
[11:14] remote agent notify the client agent
[11:16] later. Maybe when the task is done or
[11:18] hit a key milestone, even if the SSE
[11:20] connection dropped or the client was
[11:22] busy. Keeps things moving even if they
[11:24] aren't constantly watching. Got it.
[11:25] Built for things that take time. MCP's
[11:27] approach. Host manages async tool calls.
[11:30] Server can push updates. SSC. Sounds
[11:32] like the main AI app has more
[11:33] responsibility. Yeah, the host
[11:35] application using MCP generally needs to
[11:37] handle the fact that a tool call might
[11:38] not return immediately. It needs to
[11:40] manage that waiting state. Though the
[11:41] MCP server can still use SSO to send
[11:44] updates back. So slightly different
[11:46] division of labor for managing async
[11:48] operations. What about state management
[11:51] keeping track of progress? A2A has
[11:53] explicit task life cycle states.
[11:56] Submitted, working, very structured. It
[11:58] is. A2A formally defines these states so
[12:01] everyone knows exactly where a task
[12:03] stands. Crucial for coordinating complex
[12:05] workflows involving multiple steps or
[12:07] agents and MCP primarily request
[12:11] response for tools. Host manages
[12:13] workflow state simpler for the protocol
[12:15] itself. Yes, for a basic tool call it's
[12:17] often just ask get answer. If you need
[12:20] to string multiple calls together or
[12:21] manage a complex sequence that
[12:23] orchestration logic usually sits in the
[12:25] host application, not within the MCP
[12:27] protocol layer itself. Makes sense. MCP
[12:29] handles the individual connection. The
[12:31] host handles the overall plan. Okay,
[12:33] discovery mechanism. How do things find
[12:35] each other? A2A uses agent card,
[12:37] well-known agent.json registries. We
[12:40] touched on the agent card, the agents
[12:41] public profile. Registries are like
[12:43] centralized directories or marketplaces
[12:45] where agents can list themselves and
[12:46] their skills so others can search for an
[12:48] agent that meets their needs. So agents
[12:50] can announce themselves and there are
[12:52] places to look them up. How does MCP
[12:55] handle discovery? It says protocol
[12:57] methods, tools list, resources list,
[13:00] etc. Right? Once a client is connected
[13:02] to an MCP server, it can directly ask
[13:04] the server what it offers using built-in
[13:06] protocol commands like tools list to get
[13:09] the available tools or resources list
[13:11] for data. So discovery happens after
[13:14] connection in MCP querying the specific
[13:17] server. Generally, yes. A2A helps find
[13:19] the right agent to talk to. MCP helps
[13:21] find out what a specific server can do
[13:23] once you're talking to it. Key
[13:25] difference there. Okay, summing up
[13:26] strengths. A2A's keystring, enabling
[13:29] complex, dynamic, multi- aent
[13:31] collaboration really hits its core
[13:33] purpose. Absolutely. It's designed from
[13:34] the ground up for that sophisticated
[13:36] teamwork between AIS. And MCP's key
[13:39] strength, standardizing tool data
[13:41] integration and context provision,
[13:43] making it easier for agents to use
[13:45] external stuff. Exactly. Tackling that
[13:47] integration headache, providing reliable
[13:48] access to tools and information to make
[13:50] individual agents more capable. Finally,
[13:52] the table mentions key limitation
[13:55] initial for A2A ecosystem maturity,
[13:58] higher level orchestration needed.
[14:00] What's that mean? It suggests that well,
[14:02] the protocol is there, but the whole
[14:05] world of readily available A2A
[14:07] compatible agents and the sophisticated
[14:09] tools needed to manage really complex
[14:12] multi- aent workflows built on top of
[14:14] A2A. It's still developing. So, the
[14:16] foundation is there, but the building
[14:19] isn't fully constructed yet. Kind of.
[14:21] Yeah. It needs a richer ecosystem to
[14:22] truly shine. And for MCP, the limitation
[14:25] is less emphasis on inner agent
[14:28] communication. Initial off gaps
[14:30] reinforces that it's not primarily about
[14:32] agents talking to each other. And maybe
[14:34] early versions needed more work on
[14:36] authentication. Precisely. Its focus is
[14:38] vertical, not horizontal. And like any
[14:41] new standard, initial versions might
[14:43] have areas perhaps around security or
[14:45] authorization that evolve and get
[14:47] stronger over time. This whole
[14:48] comparison feature by feature really
[14:50] clarifies things. They're definitely
[14:52] solving different pieces of the puzzle.
[14:53] And crucially, as the source material
[14:55] highlights, they're seen as
[14:57] complimentary, not competing, right? You
[14:59] could totally imagine an agent using MCP
[15:02] to say fetch some data from a specific
[15:05] source and then using A2A to share that
[15:07] finding with another agent or delegate
[15:09] the next step in a process. The source
[15:11] even had a diagram showing that kind of
[15:13] synergy, didn't it? agents using MCP for
[15:16] tools APIs and A2A to coordinate amongst
[15:19] themselves. Yeah, it paints a picture of
[15:20] how these standards could work together
[15:22] in more sophisticated systems.
[15:24] Understanding both and their distinct
[15:26] roles from this table is really key if
[15:28] you want to grasp where integrated AI
[15:30] might be heading. Absolutely. So, as you
[15:33] the listener think about AI's future,
[15:36] these increasingly smart agents solving
[15:38] bigger problems keep these
[15:39] standardization efforts in mind. A2A and
[15:41] MCP aren't just technical details.
[15:43] They're potentially laying the
[15:44] groundwork for how AI will collaborate
[15:46] and interact on a massive scale. It
[15:49] raises some big questions, doesn't it?
[15:51] What happens when agents can seamlessly
[15:52] find each other, trust each other, share
[15:54] complex information, access any tool
[15:56] they need, all through standard
[15:59] protocols? It hints at this idea of an
[16:01] agent economy mentioned in the sources.
[16:03] It's a fascinating thought to end on.
[16:05] What does that economy look like? How
[16:07] does it change things? Definitely
[16:09] something to ponder. We really encourage
[16:11] you to explore the source materials
[16:13] further if this sparked your interest.
[16:15] Thanks for joining us on this deep dive.
